Implement Phase 3 of the Vue 3 frontend rewrite: Advanced Features and Modal Components. This phase should add the remaining specialized components and advanced functionality to complete the tactical awareness system.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features & Modal Components**

Based on the frontend analysis, implement the following advanced components and features:

1. **Modal Components** (in `src/components/modals/`):

   - **FlowsModal.vue** - Data flow management and configuration
   - **AlarmsModal.vue** - Alert and alarm system management
   - **SensorsModal.vue** - Sensor data display and configuration

2. **Advanced Components** (in `src/components/`):

   - **HierarchySelector.vue** - Enhanced military unit type selection with breadcrumb navigation
   - **CoordinateInput.vue** - Specialized coordinate input with validation and format conversion
   - **MilitarySymbol.vue** - Military symbology display component using MilSymbol.js
   - **NavigationCompass.vue** - Compass component for bearing display
   - **StatusIndicator.vue** - Connection and system status indicators

3. **Enhanced Map Features**:

   - **Geofencing** - Tactical area boundaries and alerts
   - **Layer Management** - Toggle different map layers and overlays
   - **Measurement Tools** - Distance and area measurement utilities

4. **Real-time Features Enhancement**:

   - **Chat System** - Real-time messaging with message history
   - **Notifications** - Toast notifications for system events
   - **Live Updates** - Real-time position tracking and status updates

5. **Form Validation and Error Handling**:

   - **Validation Composables** - Reusable validation logic
   - **Error Boundary** - Global error handling

6. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - **Virtual Scrolling** - For large lists in sidebar
   - **Debouncing** - Search and input debouncing

7. **Accessibility and UX**:

   - **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard support
   - **Screen Reader Support** - ARIA labels and descriptions
   - **Touch Gestures** - Mobile-friendly interactions
   - **Responsive Design** - Enhanced mobile layout

8. **Testing Setup**:
   - **Unit Tests** - Component testing with Vitest
   - **Integration Tests** - API and store testing
   - **E2E Tests** - Critical user flow testing
   - **Test Utilities** - Shared testing helpers

**Key Requirements:**

- Complete feature parity with original implementation
- Maintain military standards and tactical functionality
- Ensure all modals work correctly with Vuetify 3
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add comprehensive testing coverage
- Optimize performance for large datasets
- Maintain RTL support throughout

**Focus Areas:**

- All modal components should be fully functional
- Chat system should work with real-time messaging
- Military symbology should display correctly
- Form validation should match original behavior
- Performance should be optimized for production use
- Testing should cover critical functionality

This phase should result in a complete, production-ready tactical awareness application with all advanced features and proper testing coverage.

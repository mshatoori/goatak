Many many issues with phase 1 & 2:

1. The location shown on map for the user is wrong (differs from the location taken from API)
2. The icons should not be draggable! They are not in the legacy code.
3. Map tiles are not loaded from the correct source. The source of map tiles should be taken from `/config` endpoint. See `http_server.go`
4. Unit don't have the correct milSymbol icons. They are shown similar to self icon! Fix it.

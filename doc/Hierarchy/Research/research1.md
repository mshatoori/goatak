# **Incorporating Command Hierarchy in SA Systems and the TAK Ecosystem**

## **Hierarchy in Existing Situational Awareness Systems**

Modern military situational awareness (SA) systems like FBCB2/JCR (Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below – Joint Capabilities Release), Nett Warrior, and various international Battlefield Management Systems (BMS) are built to reflect the chain of command. They **leverage force hierarchies (echelons)** to tailor information display and data flow for each user’s role. This prevents information overload at lower levels while ensuring higher commanders retain the broader picture[\[1\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Whatever%20the%20display%20used%2C%20the,the%20company%20and%20battalion%20levels). Key aspects of hierarchy in these systems include unit-based filtering of the common operational picture, role-based message routing, and permission controls aligned with the command structure.

- **Unit Visibility Filtering:** SA systems restrict or filter the view of the battlefield based on a unit’s echelon and context. For example, the U.S. Army’s FBCB2 was designed so that each echelon sees the _Common Operational Picture (COP)_ roughly “two echelons up and down and one adjacent unit left and right”[\[2\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=b,the%20effectiveness%20of%20the%20force). A company commander, for instance, would see his company’s units, his immediate higher HQ (battalion and brigade), plus neighboring companies – but not every unit in the theater. This focuses the display on relevant forces. Similarly, modern BMS software is **optimized to show more detailed but limited views to junior leaders and a broader overview to senior commanders**[\[1\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Whatever%20the%20display%20used%2C%20the,the%20company%20and%20battalion%20levels). In the French **SCORPION/SICS** or Danish **SitaWare** systems, a platoon leader’s device automatically filters and simplifies data (showing nearby squads and threats), whereas a battalion C2 node can aggregate and display the entire battlegroup’s picture in more complexity[\[1\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Whatever%20the%20display%20used%2C%20the,the%20company%20and%20battalion%20levels)[\[3\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Delivering%20the%20situational%20awareness%20picture,Typical%20examples%20are). This echelon-based filtering is critical to reduce clutter and cognitive load on front-line users.
- **Hierarchical Map Representations:** Command hierarchy is also encoded visually. Systems following MIL-STD-2525 symbology mark unit icons with an echelon indicator (e.g. one dot \= squad, **XX** \= battalion, etc.). These icons give an instant sense of unit size/level on the map. Higher echelon commanders often have the ability to toggle map layers – for example, viewing only platoon leaders’ icons instead of every individual soldier to declutter the map. In FBCB2/JCR, **map overlays are managed per echelon and staff function**: multiple smaller overlay files are used (instead of one huge graphic) so that, say, a battalion S-3 can send only the relevant control measures to companies[\[4\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=%282%29%20%C2%A0%20%C2%A0%20Overlays,operators%20in%20reducing%20screen%20clutter)[\[5\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,CPs%20and%20any%20analog%20units). Each staff section creates overlays for their functional area, and these are distributed **upward or downward as needed** (after senior staff review)[\[5\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,CPs%20and%20any%20analog%20units). Lower units open only the overlays they need, maintaining focus[\[4\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=%282%29%20%C2%A0%20%C2%A0%20Overlays,operators%20in%20reducing%20screen%20clutter)[\[5\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,CPs%20and%20any%20analog%20units). This layered approach aligns with hierarchy – e.g. a brigade’s operational graphics might be a separate layer that battalions can choose to display.
- **Message Routing and Delivery:** Hierarchical **routing of messages** is a core design feature. In FBCB2/JCR, messages (such as spot reports or orders) are not simply broadcast to all nodes; they are addressed to specific roles or units. Each platform has an **address book of unit roles** (populated dynamically via JCR’s Self-Descriptive Situational Awareness, SDSA) so users can select recipients by unit/function[\[6\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=,Each%20platform)[\[7\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=The%20information%20contained%20in%20SDSA,In%20addition). A typical doctrine is that a report from a lower unit should be sent to its higher headquarters and relevant adjacent units, not to everyone. For example, when a soldier sends a SPOT report in FBCB2, it _generates an icon that all on the network can see_, but **only the addressed recipients get the detailed text**[\[8\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,and%20create%20multiple%20reports%2C%20the). A platoon leader might address a contact report to “Company HQ” and the battalion S2; those addressees receive the message text (and can act on it), while everyone else merely sees a new enemy icon on the map[\[8\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,and%20create%20multiple%20reports%2C%20the)[\[9\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,the%20close%20and%20rear%20battles). This ensures critical info reaches the chain of command without inundating others with irrelevant messages. Importantly, FBCB2 doctrine required including the higher HQ intelligence officer in the address list of enemy reports so that the info routes up to the brigade intelligence system[\[9\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=,the%20close%20and%20rear%20battles). Other armies’ BMS have similar **role-based routing**. For instance, reports on a UK Bowman or an Israeli TORCH-X system can be directed to specific callsigns or functional roles (FSO, logistics, etc.), mimicking traditional radio nets but in digital form.
- **Access Control and Permissions:** Many SA systems implement access controls aligned with hierarchy and security. On the basic level, every user/device is associated with a unit and echelon, which governs what they _should_ see. In U.S. systems, a critical divide is classification: for example **JCR introduced NSA Type 1 encryption** so that a subset of users could operate on the SECRET network, while others remained on an unclassified network[\[10\]](https://www.scribd.com/doc/95102701/Army-Battle-Command-System-Pocket-Guide#:~:text=FBCB2,Text%20messages%2C%20and%20SPOT%20Reporting)[\[11\]](https://www.scribd.com/doc/95102701/Army-Battle-Command-System-Pocket-Guide#:~:text=SECRET%20NETWORK). This effectively separated feeds by echelon (e.g. Secret for battalion and above, SBU for company and below) – a form of access control ensuring that only authorized levels see certain data. Another aspect is coalition operations: systems like FBCB2 had to support sharing a COP with allies on networks like **CENTRIXS** with strict filtering of what each nation can view[\[12\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=e,domain%20is%20referred%20to%20as). Modern BMS architectures include role-based user accounts or profiles. For example, a system might allow only a user logged in as a commander to approve certain operations or to see all subordinate unit locations, whereas a soldier login sees only peers in his squad. In practice, older platforms like FBCB2 didn’t have individual logins (the device was tied to a platform/unit), but **future SA systems are trending toward user identity and roles**. (Notably, the upcoming U.S. Mounted Mission Command (MMC-S) will use an Android-based interface with user accounts, likely leveraging roles similar to the ATAK environment[\[13\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=BMSs%20are%20part%20of%20a,ATAK%29%20that%20most%20soldiers).)
- **User Interface Tailored to Echelon:** The complexity of the UI and available functions often vary by echelon. **Nett Warrior**, as a dismounted leader system, is essentially a smartphone-based SA tool for platoon and squad leaders – its interface prioritizes quick, local situational awareness (nearby friendlies, simple icons, and text messages) rather than large-scale planning tools. By contrast, a brigade or division TOC system (like **CPOF** or earlier ABCS systems) shows many layers of data and analytic tools. Even within the same system, the UI may offer **mode switches or filters for different roles**. For example, JCR and its successor JBC-P (Joint Battle Command–Platform) provided improved map graphics and let users toggle data sets on/off[\[14\]](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/364542/1st-cavalry-division-holds-jcr-training#:~:text=1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20holds%20JCR,vehicle%20to%20locate%20their)[\[1\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Whatever%20the%20display%20used%2C%20the,the%20company%20and%20battalion%20levels). Many international BMS follow a similar principle: **the battalion commander’s workstation might show the whole battlegroup**, multiple overlays, and feeds from ISR assets, whereas **a vehicle commander’s display (BMS frontline)** highlights immediate tactical elements. In the Israeli TORCH-X suite, each echelon has a dedicated application configuration: _division-to-battalion HQ systems_ have full COP and planning tools, while _platoon-level apps_ focus on navigation, targets, and reporting, with simplified visuals[\[15\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=The%20Israeli%20Army%20has%20also,hardware%2C%20software%2C%20and%20communications%20equipment). This tiered UI design aligns with military doctrine – junior leaders get what they need to fight their fight, and senior leaders maintain oversight and coordination.
- **Hierarchy in Other National Systems:** The importance of echelon is universal. Europe’s latest BMS programs explicitly design for hierarchical info flow. The French **SICS** (System d’information du combat Scorpion) integrates all elements of a battlegroup and distributes appropriate views to each level[\[16\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Start%20%20%2038%20Technology,Advancing%20Battle%20Management%20Systems)[\[17\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=the%20French%20SCORPION%20Combat%20Information,tanks%20of%20the%20Turkish%20Army). The Norwegian **NOR BMS/FIS** and Danish **Systematic SitaWare Frontline** similarly allow filtering by organizational layers and have features for commanders to drill down or roll up views of subordinate units. These systems leverage data fusion at higher HQ and then push a digest to lower units. A recent analysis notes that at battalion level the BMS will **“manipulate information for presentation to commanders at platoon, company, and battalion levels… Different formats are tailored for each level to prevent information overload.”**[\[3\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=Delivering%20the%20situational%20awareness%20picture,Typical%20examples%20are) This reflects a design consensus: _successful SA systems are echelon-aware by design_. Additionally, military doctrine (e.g. U.S. Army mission command and NATO C2 principles) underpins these designs by stipulating that commanders require a COP relevant to their mission and level[\[2\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=b,the%20effectiveness%20of%20the%20force) while avoiding inundating subordinates with extraneous data. The hierarchy of forces is thus not just an org chart – it is built into how information moves and is displayed on the battlefield.

## **Implementing Echelon-Aware Features in the TAK Ecosystem**

The Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem (including ATAK for Android, WinTAK for Windows, and the TAK Server) can incorporate these hierarchical principles to enhance military use. TAK is inherently a flexible, network-centric platform using the Cursor on Target (CoT) protocol for data exchange. By adding awareness of force structure (who belongs to which unit, and at what echelon), TAK-based systems can achieve similar benefits to legacy SA systems. Below are actionable approaches for making the TAK ecosystem “hierarchy-aware” in terms of CoT messages, user management, filtering, and data dissemination:

### **Encoding Unit Hierarchy in CoT Messages**

CoT messages are the heartbeat of TAK, conveying position tracks and other events in XML. While CoT already supports basic categorization (e.g. the type field aligns with MIL-STD-2525 symbol codes), it can be extended to carry unit hierarchy info. One approach is to use CoT **“detail” fields or an optional schema extension** to include the unit identifier, echelon, and possibly parent unit. For example, an ATAK client could inject a custom \<uid\> or \<unit\> tag in the CoT event’s detail, e.g. \<unit name="1PLT A Co/1-23IN" echelon="Platoon" parentUID="A Co/1-23IN"/\>. This metadata would travel with the CoT location reports and allow receivers to know the sender’s unit context. Notably, earlier systems provide a model for this: in FBCB2 JCR’s SDSA broadcast, each platform publishes its **Unit Reference Number (URN), role (duty position), and other identifiers** to everyone on the network[\[6\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=,Each%20platform)[\[7\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=The%20information%20contained%20in%20SDSA,In%20addition). This lets devices dynamically build an address book of who is in which unit. TAK could implement a similar concept via CoT. For instance, a TAK client on start-up might send a CoT event advertising its **“callsign” and unit hierarchy**, which other clients or the server use to update a roster. The CoT protocol is extensible – indeed it anticipates extra components in the type field or detail for machine filtering[\[18\]](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/About/architecture/mil_std_2525/#:~:text=Future%20versions%20of%20this%20schema,delimited%20by%20the%20semicolon%20character)[\[19\]](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/About/architecture/mil_std_2525/#:~:text=simple%20filtering%2C%20translation%20and%20display). By adhering to the MIL-STD-2525 symbol codes, **the iconography in ATAK already denotes echelon (if the correct SIDC is used)**, but to truly leverage hierarchy we need explicit unit grouping data.

A concrete recommendation is to adopt a naming scheme or CoT **UID convention** that encodes hierarchy. For example, the UID could contain the unit and sub-unit (such as a GUID prefixed by unit code). Alternatively, a separate CoT event type (or a control message) could outline the task organization. This would enable features like **tap on a higher unit icon to expand subordinate elements**, or allow filtering all CoT events by a unit tree. In summary, adding **unit identifiers and echelon tags to CoT messages** (while remaining backward compatible) will enable the TAK system to treat CoT feeds not just as flat lists of tracks, but as an organized force structure.

### **Hierarchy-Based User Roles and Permissions**

The TAK Server supports users, groups, and roles, which can be aligned to military roles. Administrators should define **user roles corresponding to echelon or function** – e.g. _Team Member_, _Platoon Leader_, _Company Commander_, _HQ Staff_, etc. These roles can then be granted permissions consistent with their information needs. For instance, a _Team Member_ role might be prevented from seeing other teams’ locations (to simulate need-to-know), whereas a _Commander_ role has permission to view all friendly tracks. The TAK Server’s organization model can be leveraged here: one can create separate **organizational groups for each unit** (platoons, companies, etc.) and assign users accordingly[\[20\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=Is%20there%20a%20way%20to,do%20hierarchy%20authorization%20in%20ATAK)[\[21\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fmytecknet.com%2Fmanaging). Out of the box, TAK Server allows defining **data-sharing rules per group** – effectively who can see whose data. By configuring these “ingress/egress” rules for each org, we implement hierarchy-based access control. For example, set Company A’s group to only receive CoT from A’s platoons, Company B’s from B’s platoons, etc., while a Battalion group receives from all companies. Recent versions of TAK Server have an admin GUI option to control _what data goes in and out for each group_, making this straightforward[\[22\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/105br2m/hierarchy_displays/#:~:text=Hierarchy%20displays%20%3A%20r%2FATAK%20,into%20the%20admin%20gui%20now).

Additionally, **role-based permissions** can control features: a higher role user might be allowed to inject tasks or markers that subordinate-level users cannot delete or might not even see if not addressed to them. In a coalition or multi-agency context, roles can enforce that, say, a liaison officer sees only a subset of data. The use of directory services (LDAP/Active Directory) with TAK Server can aid in managing these roles at scale[\[21\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fmytecknet.com%2Fmanaging). Overall, defining a clear mapping of military chain-of-command to TAK roles, and using the server’s role-based access, ensures that the **principle of “right info to the right echelon” is maintained in the digital COP**.

### **Echelon-Based Filtering of Tracks and Events**

Both the client side (ATAK/WinTAK) and server side should implement **filtering mechanisms by echelon**. On ATAK/WinTAK, this could mean a user can choose to filter the map display to show only certain echelons. For example, an overwhelmed company commander could toggle “show platoon leaders only,” hiding individual soldier icons and thereby decluttering the map. This can be achieved if CoT events carry an echelon label (as above) or if a naming convention is used (e.g., unit icon types differ). A practical approach is to utilize the **2525 symbology**: ATAK already reads CoT type to choose an icon – by embedding the correct echelon amplifier in the SIDC or in the type string, the client can natively distinguish echelons (e.g. an infantry platoon icon vs. battalion icon). The client UI could then include a filter menu by echelon (similar to filtering by affiliation or type that exists today).

On the server side, **feed filtering** is crucial for bandwidth management in large deployments. The server can maintain separate topic channels for different echelons. For instance, all soldier-level CoT traffic might stay within a company feed, with only summary or key events forwarded upward. This concept was effectively used in older systems via network design – e.g. **FBCB2 had a “flattened” network in JCR, but before that units were on separate subnetworks with gateways bridging upward**[\[23\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=,Platforms%20are%20not)[\[24\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=TOC%20serves%20as%20the%20access,dependency%20between%20platform%20and%20role). In TAK, one can replicate this by running multiple TAK servers or logical federations: each company connects to a company server (or room), and a battalion-level server subscribes to those feeds for an aggregate view. In fact, **community best practice suggests using separate servers (or server groups) per team/unit and a federation hub to tie them together**[\[25\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=Separate%20server%20and%20a%20federation,one%20way%20to%20do%20it). Federation in TAK means a server can forward events between servers selectively. By configuring federation routes, you can ensure, for example, that only certain event types or summary CoTs go from a company server up to battalion. This limits unnecessary chatter across echelons.

In the current TAK Server (5.x), the **Group In/Out filter** feature can be used to implement such selective dissemination without multiple servers. An admin can specify that Group (Org) “1st Platoon” shares its data _outbound_ only with its parent group “Alpha Company”, and not with other platoons. Likewise, the company’s inbound settings can accept only its platoons. Meanwhile, the battalion’s group would have inbound from all companies. This effectively mirrors radio nets or multicast groups by echelon, but managed at the server. By using these filters, **each echelon’s COP is automatically pruned**: a platoon member only receives CoT events from within platoon (plus any specifically sent by higher HQ), whereas the company HQ receives all platoon CoTs under it, and so on. Such filtering not only reduces cognitive overload but also saves network bandwidth (critical in tactical networks).

### **Data Dissemination Paths and Feed Configuration per Role**

Achieving an echelon-aware architecture in TAK may require designing the **data dissemination paths** – how data flows from one level to another – intentionally. Here are some recommended configurations:

- **Hierarchical Feed Topology:** Organize the TAK connectivity in a tree (or hub-and-spoke) topology reflecting unit hierarchy. For example, deploy TAK servers at brigade, battalion, and company levels (these could be cloud servers, command post servers, or even mobile “edge” servers). Company-level servers handle all traffic from devices in the company (dismounted ATAK users, vehicle WinTAK, etc.). These company servers then **feed upward** to the battalion server only the information needed at battalion – possibly via a federation rule or publish/subscribe to only higher-level tracks. The battalion server in turn feeds the brigade. This way, data is partitioned: lower-level tactical chatter can be contained, and higher HQ gets a consolidated view. The federation hub approach is proven in practice (it’s suggested by TAK users for isolating teams)[\[25\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=Separate%20server%20and%20a%20federation,one%20way%20to%20do%20it). TAK Server’s federation or the newer **TAK Broker** can be configured to forward CoT events by criteria (e.g., forward only events tagged as “HQ” or important). One could designate certain CoT message types for roll-up (for instance, a platoon leader’s device might send a periodic summary of platoon locations as a single CoT event that is meant for higher HQ).
- **Per-Role Data Logic:** Use **CoT event type or fields to indicate message priority or intended audience**, and configure dissemination accordingly. For example, one could define that all emergency or high-priority events (MEDEVAC requests, enemy sightings) are broadcast to all echelons, whereas routine position updates are kept within their org unless a higher HQ explicitly requests them. The CoT format’s flexibility allows tagging events (perhaps in the \<remarks\> or an extension) with labels like “FOR BN” or “FOR ALL.” A custom plugin on TAK Server could read these and route the message to the appropriate clients or groups. **Successful doctrine in radio usage – like only passing critical reports up the chain – can be codified in CoT routing rules.** In essence, the server would act like a smart router, similar to how FBCB2’s network software or Tactical Services Gateway decided which data went to higher TI networks[\[26\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=information%20passing%20from%20the%20SGS,nets%20to%20connect%20all%20vehicles)[\[27\]](https://www.scribd.com/document/328442151/FBCB2-Users-Guide-pdf#:~:text=are%20then%20linked%20through%20the,the%20Satellite%20Transceiver%20based%20and).
- **Leveraging Group Hierarchies:** The TAK Server supports nested organizations (parent-child groups). Administrators can structure these to mirror the military hierarchy (e.g. Platoon groups under a Company group, under a Battalion group). Then, by default, a higher-level group could be configured to **subscribe to all sub-group traffic**, while sub-groups do not see lateral traffic. This natively accomplishes a hierarchy feed: a battalion TOC user account in the parent group automatically gets all CoTs from child groups (companies), but a company user only gets its own. Using the **“org admin” roles and publish permissions**, one can also allow higher HQ to inject data into subordinates’ feeds when needed (e.g. sending an order or target to a specific unit group). Community discussions note that **TAK Server’s admin UI now allows setting per-group data flow rules easily**, which is an ideal mechanism to enforce these paths without custom code.
- **Summaries and Aggregation:** Borrowing from techniques in advanced BMS, one can implement **aggregation at echelon boundaries**. For example, instead of a brigade HQ tracking 40 individual platoon markers, the battalion server (or a plugin there) could aggregate those into a single battalion-level marker or operational graphic for the brigade view. This could be done by a server-side script that listens for all platoon CoTs and produces a “bounding box” or representative icon. While TAK doesn’t do this out-of-the-box, it’s feasible via the plugin API or an external service consuming CoT. Such logic can be guided by doctrine – e.g., a battalion commander might only need the general vicinity of each company, not every team’s precise location. Implementing this requires careful design (to avoid misrepresentation), but it aligns with military practice of reporting unit locations by headquarters element at higher echelons rather than every individual.

In summary, to infuse force hierarchy into the TAK ecosystem, we should **use a combination of structured data (unit IDs in CoT), server-side group and role management, and network architecture** that mirrors command chains. Many of these features are supported by TAK Server’s current capabilities (groups, roles, filtering). By configuring them according to military unit structure, ATAK/WinTAK clients in the field will experience a COP that’s appropriately filtered: a soldier sees his squad and nearest leadership, a company commander sees all his platoons, and higher commanders can drill down but aren’t overwhelmed by every soldier’s icon. The result will be a TAK-driven situational awareness system that, much like legacy military SA systems, delivers _“the right information to the right people at the right time”_ – in line with both technical best practices and established military doctrine.

· **Reddit ATAK Community Q\&A** – offers practical insight that implementing hierarchy can be done via separate servers or built-in group filters on TAK Server[\[25\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=Separate%20server%20and%20a%20federation,one%20way%20to%20do%20it)[\[29\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/comments/191gvuk/hierarchy_authorization_in_atak/#:~:text=Use%20groups,settings%20per%20user%20on%20takserver), advice which our TAK configuration recommendations follow.

· **TORCH-X and others** – demonstrated multi-echelon configurations (from division to platoon) with specialized applications for each level[\[15\]](https://euro-sd.com/2023/03/articles/30027/advancing-battle-management-systems/#:~:text=The%20Israeli%20Army%20has%20also,hardware%2C%20software%2C%20and%20communications%20equipment), serving as a successful example that TAK could emulate by plugin or configuration for different role devices (e.g. an ATAK plugin for higher HQ functions).

By learning from these sources and doctrines, developers and integrators of the TAK ecosystem can create a truly echelon-aware situational awareness network – one that scales information and access according to the chain of command, just as legacy military systems have done, but with the flexibility and interoperability that modern CoT/TAK technology provides.[\[2\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-21-21/appb.htm#:~:text=b,the%20effectiveness%20of%20the%20force)

When selecting any item on the map (drawing, unit, point, route, casevac, alarm) I want there to be some clear data about navigating to that item in the item details in the sidebar.

This is the implementation in the WinTAK, but it's way too complicated.
For us, thess fields would suffice:
1. Bearing
2. Distance (km)

In addition, there should be a checkbox near these data that when selected, show a faint line between the user's icon on the map and the selected object.

In the SensorModal, it's only possible to add a new sensor or delete one. You need to implement edit functionality for the sensorModal, so the user can click a edit button to make an existing sensor editable (turn text to inputs). The edit button would be replaced with a save button when the sensor is editable. When saved, a PUT request should be sent to server. Add the new API function in the `cmd/webclient/http_sensors.go` beside all other sensor related APIs.
Make sure to stop, re-initialize and start the sensor when edited.
